# Residual Networks

We will be building a very deep convolutional network, using Residual Networks (ResNets). In theory, very deep networks can represent very complex functions; but in practice, they are hard to train. Residual Networks, introduced by [He et al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385.pdf), allow you to train much deeper networks than were previously feasible.

**By the end of this project, we'll be able to:**

- Implement the basic building blocks of ResNets in a deep neural network using Keras
- Put together these building blocks to implement and train a state-of-the-art neural network for image classification
- Implement a skip connection in your network

For this assignment, we'll use Keras.
